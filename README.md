# Water sports tracking iOS

Water sports are mainly individual activities without many safety measures. As athletes are disconnected from land when playing, dangerous situations are difficult to predict. Therefore, this iOS app allows to maintain contact with people and alerts about weather changes. This is achieved due to waterproof wearables.

Moreover, as most athletes train and plan training session independently, this app combines safety, progress tracking and training session planning based on weather conditions.
